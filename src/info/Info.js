I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

of what each of the values mean.

    bio: <p>
    a B.Tech Computer Science student at 
  <b> ITM (SLS) Baroda University</b>. Growing up in Gujarat, I've always been 
  curious about technology and how it shapes the world around us. That curiosity 
  turned into passion, and today I enjoy learning, experimenting, and improving 
  my skills in the field of programming and software development.
  <br /><br />
  I love working on <b>web development</b> and <b>software engineering</b>, 
  exploring both the creative side of design and the logical side of coding. 
  For me, programming is not just about solving problems, but also about creating 
  meaningful experiences and continuously learning new ways to innovate.
  <br /><br />
  Outside the world of code, I enjoy exploring new ideas, keeping up with tech 
  trends, and finding inspiration in everyday experiences. I believe in growth 
  through curiosity, creativity, and consistency â€” values that drive me forward 
  as I build my career in technology.
